# Rockall Trough Volume, Heat and Freshwater Transports
This repository uses moored and glider observations from the Ellet Array to calculate volume, heat and freshwater transports through the northern Rockall Trough.

The Rockall Trough moorings, located at approximately 57° north 11° west, form the eastern boundary of the international OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Programme) array. This observing system has measured the full depth, basin-wide overturning circulation and associated transport of heat and freshwater since 2014. The Rockall Trough component is funded through the Atlantic Climate and Environment Strategic Science (AtlantiS) (NE/Y005589/1) and Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science (CLASS) (NE/R015953/1), along with NERC grants U.K. OSNAP Decade (NE/T00858X/1 and NE/T008938/1). It consists of three vertical moorings in the boundaries of the subpolar basin, supplemented by glider missions to provide contemporaneous temperature and salinity information. Data included in this release were sampled between July 2014 and July 2022 and are from single point current meters and moored CTD instruments, providing measurements of water velocity, temperature, salinity, and pressure.
